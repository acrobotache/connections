The main goal of `connections` is to integrate `DBI`-compliant packages with the RStudio IDE's [Connection
Pane](https://db.rstudio.com/rstudio/connections/).  Packages such as [RPostgres](https://github.com/r-dbi/RPostgres), [RSQLite](https://github.com/r-dbi/RSQLite), [RMariaDB](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB) and [bigrquery](https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery) connect R to those databases, but do not provide a direct integration with the Connections Pane. `connections` reads the configuration of the connection and creates the integration with RStudio.

A second goal is to provide integration with the [pins](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/) package.  The `connections` package allows you to pin database connections and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) table objects. 

A third goal of `connections` is to provide a simpler API to the way RStudio Connections pane integrates with R.  This is meant for use by advanced R developers who wish to create custom connection configurations, or for `DBI`-compliant package developers who wish to directly integrate the Connections pane with their package. 

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("edgararuiz/connections")
```
