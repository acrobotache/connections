<!-- badges: end -->

The main goal of `connections` is to integrate `DBI`-compliant packages
with the RStudio IDEâ€™s [Connection
Pane](https://db.rstudio.com/rstudio/connections/). Packages such as
[RPostgres](https://github.com/r-dbi/RPostgres),
[RSQLite](https://github.com/r-dbi/RSQLite),
[RMariaDB](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB) and
[bigrquery](https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery) connect R to those
databases, but do not provide a direct integration with the Connections
Pane. `connections` reads the configuration of the connection and
creates the integration with RStudio.

A second goal is to provide integration with the
[pins](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/) package. The `connections`
package allows you to pin database connections and
[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) table objects.

A third goal of `connections` is to provide a simpler API to the way
RStudio Connections pane integrates with R. This is meant for use by
advanced R developers who wish to create custom connection
configurations, or for `DBI`-compliant package developers who wish to
directly integrate the Connections pane with their package.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("edgararuiz/connections")
```

## Using

The two main functions added by `connections` are:

  - `connection_open()` - Opens the database connection. Use instead of
    `dbConnect()`, but use the exact same arguments. It also
    automatically starts the Connections pane.
  - `connection_close()` - Closes the database connection.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(connections)
library(RSQLite)

con <- connection_open(SQLite(), "local.sqlite")
```

The connection can now be closed by using the appropriate button in the
Connections pane, or by using
`connection_close()`

``` r
connection_close(con)
```

<!--html_preserve-->

<img src='man/figures/connection-2.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;'/><br/><!--/html_preserve-->

The connection code is parsed when connecting to the database, and it is
visible once the connection is closed.

### `dplyr`

`connections` integrates with `dplyr` by supporting the following two
functions:

  - `tbl()` - To create a pointer to a table or view within the
    database.
  - `copy_to()` - To copy data from the R session to the database.

The version of `copy_to()` inside `connections` automatically updates
the Connections pane, so the new table automatically shows up.

``` r
con <- connection_open(SQLite(), "local.sqlite")

copy_to(con, mtcars, temporary = FALSE, overwrite = TRUE)
```

To use an existing table inside the database use
`tbl()`.

``` r
db_mtcars <- tbl(con, "mtcars")
```

<!--html_preserve-->

<img src='man/figures/pane-1.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;'/><br/><!--/html_preserve-->

The `tbl()` function opens the rest of the already available `dplyr`
database integration.

``` r
db_mtcars %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `pins`

The `connections` package integrates with `pins`. It enables the ability
to save and retrieve connections and queries.

``` r
library(pins)
board_register_local(cache = "~/pins")
```

### Pin a connection

Use the same `pin()` command to save a database connection. Under the
hood, `connections` saves the **necessary information to recreate the
connection code, not the actual connection R
object**.

``` r
pin(con, "my_conn", board = "local")
```

<!--html_preserve-->

<img src='man/figures/pins-1.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;'/><br/><!--/html_preserve-->

Use `pin_get()` to re-open the connection. In effect, `pin_get()` will
replay the exact same code used to initially connect to the database.
This means that `connection_open()` is already called for you, so the
Connections pane should automatically start up.

``` r
con <- pin_get("my_conn", board = "local")
```

Assign the output of `pin_get()` to a variable, such as `con`. The
variable will work just like any connection variable.

``` r
db_mtcars <- tbl(con, "mtcars") %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE))

db_mtcars
```

### Pin a `dplyr` database query

When `dplyr` works with database data, the resulting query is not
executed until the data is explicitly collected into R, or when printing
the top results to the R Console. The `pin` records two things:

  - The `dplyr` R object that contains all of the transformations. **It
    does not save the actual results**.
  - The necessary information to recreate the database connection. This
    is to make sure that the data is being retrieved from the original
    database
connection.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
pin(db_mtcars, "avg_mpg", board = "local")
```

<!--html_preserve-->

<img src='man/figures/pins-2.png' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;'/><br/><!--/html_preserve-->

`pin_get()` will connect to the database, and return the `dplyr` object.
Without assigning it to a variable, the pin will immediately print the
results of the database. Those results are being processed at the time
`pin_get()` runs.

``` r
pin_get("avg_mpg", board = "local")
```

### Full `pins` example

The way `pins` integrates with databases, via the `connections` package,
allows to open the connection from a pin, and pipe all of the subsequent
code into a new pin. Afterwards, that pin can be used to collect or to
continue using the `dplyr` object.

``` r
pin_get("my_conn", board = "local") %>%
  tbl("mtcars") %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pin("cyl_mpg", board = "local")

pin_get("cyl_mpg", board = "local")
```
